<h1>DSA in Java</h1>

<p>
Finally decided to learn DSA properly, haha. This is where I’ll document everything — resources, assignments, LeetCode questions, or anything else I work on, no matter where I learn it from. Feel free to use it however you like. I’ll also add my thoughts, tips, and helpful pointers to make things easier for anyone needing a hand.
