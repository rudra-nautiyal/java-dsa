<h1>Java DSA</h1>

<p>
Finally decided to learn DSA properly, haha. This is where I’ll document everything — resources, assignments, LeetCode questions, or anything else I work on, no matter where I learn it from. Feel free to use it however you like. I’ll also be adding my own thoughts, tips, and helpful pointers to make things easier for anyone who might need a hand.
